If you're using Visual Studio Code and the SSH extension to connect to a Linux machine using public and private keys, here's how you can set it up:


1. **Generate SSH Key Pair** (if you haven't already):

Use the ssh-keygen command on your Windows machine to generate an SSH key pair. Open a terminal (e.g., PowerShell) and run:  

```
bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Replace "your_email@example.com" with your email address. This command will generate a public key (id_rsa.pub) and a private key (id_rsa) in your user's .ssh directory (usually C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh).
```

note: email id can be anything.

Replace **"your_email@example.com"** with your email address. This command will generate a public key (**id_rsa.pub**) and a private key (**id_rsa**) in your user's **.ssh** directory (usually **C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh**).
